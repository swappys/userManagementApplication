This application is for User registration, Login, logout and updating the information of the user. I have used MongoDB as the datastore for it. 
After the application source code is pulled, run npm install to install all the dependencies mentioned in package.json file.
I have added a swagger UI for documentation purposes for easy understanding of the REST Endpoints.
After running locally, Swagger UI can be accessed using the following url ->(http://localhost:8000/api-docs)
